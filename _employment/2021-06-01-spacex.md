Joined at an interesting time™: owned a big piece of ground software for satellites/other assets management for the growing Starlink Network.

Developed high-availability, multi-region, real-time data products used by 1k+ internal users 24/7/365 to operate 7k+ satellites and other fleet/network settings. 

Enabled 100x customer (50k→5M+) and 10x satellite (700→7k+) growth by building automation and observability tools for asset management - web applications and data pipelines.

Apart from individual contrubutor work, I was a people manager for 3+ years, grew team from 3 to 6, promoted 4 engineers, communicated with executives etc.

FUN TIMES @Constellation_Tools!
